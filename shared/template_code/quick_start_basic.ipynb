This Notebook will discuss some details, but check out our full [Kaggle Packages documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/packages) for more information.\n\nWe use the open-source [`nbdev` library](https://nbdev.fast.ai) which lets you define a Python Package within a Jupyter Notebook. When you `Save Version`, we'll run your whole Notebook as usual, then *also* export all cells with `nbdev`'s special `#| export` tag to a Python Package.  You can navigate to this Notebook's `Output` tab to see the Package it exported!\n\nIn this competition, you'll write a Package which defines a `class Model` with a `def predict(inputs)` function which returns your predictions. Unlike most Kaggle Code Competitions, you no longer have to manually read the test set, run your inference loop, and write a submission file.  Kaggle Packages expand on some \"API-based\" Code Competitions we've run recently which experimented with similar improvements, and are also an extension of our older Utility Script functionality.\n1. When you submit to the competition, our internal scoring system will install your Package and run inference over the hidden test set using your `Model`.\n2. You can use `kagglehub` to install Packages (your own, or any public Packages) elsewhere (on Kaggle, Colab, your machine, etc) and run inference on arbitrary inputs or hook them into an ML pipeline, etc.\n3. In the future, we may utilize more `nbdev` features like automated documentation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Writing a Package Notebook with `nbdev`\n\nWith `nbdev`, you write your **Notebook** (you are here) which will run when you `Save Version` as usual, but then *also* exports a subset of its code into the Notebook's Output as a **Python Package**, which can later be imported elsewhere.\n\nFor example, your Notebook could train a model (code not exported) and export its weights, then **export** your `Model` code which loads those model weights and implements inference in a `predict` function, then run some tests on your `Model` (code not exported) to make sure it works before saving.\n\n`nbdev` usage:\n1. You must have a code cell with `#| default_exp core` which tells `nbdev` to export a Package from this Notebook and write to `core.py`.\n2. You must **explicitly tag cells** with `#| export` syntax to export them. Cells without that tag are *not* exported.\n\nYou must make sure that your Package can run on its own and is not reliant on non-exported code, and also follows the competition's expected format (discussed below).  When you `Save Version`, we perform a **Validation Run** on your exported Package which looks for common errors and flags them for you.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#| default_exp core","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-03-22T06:54:15.706007Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-03-22T06:54:15.706398Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-03-22T06:54:15.710131Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-03-22T06:54:15.706361Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-03-22T06:54:15.709148Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The above cell is **required** to produce a Package, it tells `nbdev` to export a Package from this Notebook and write to `core.py`.

Below we discuss more advanced functionality you can use with Kaggle Packages.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing datasources with `kagglehub`\n\nIf you want your model to use Kaggle Datasources -- Datasets, Models, Notebooks, even other Packages -- you must use `kagglehub` to load it, so that your Package is re-usable and not dependent on implementation details of our Notebooks platform such as our special `/kaggle/input` directory.\n\nExample code cell:\n\n```python\n#| export\n\nimport kagglehub\nimport keras\n\nclass Model:\n    def __init__(self):\n        model_weights_path = kagglehub.model_download('your/model/here', 'model.weights')\n        self.model = keras.saving.load_model(model_weights_path)\n\n    def predict(self, prompt):\n        return self.model.predict(prompt)\n```\n\nYou can still attach Datasources using the Editor sidebar, and use its `Copy kagglehub command` option to get the right code to run in your Notebook.\n\nIn fact, your Notebook *must* have all Datasources attached before `Save Version`.  You can do this either in the Editor sidebar, or just by executing your `kagglehub` command in your Interactive session.  In this example, the latter would occur simply by instantiating `model = Model()` or running `kaggle_evaluation.test(Model)` which would do the same.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Storing files in your Package\n\nYour Notebook can save **asset** files to your Package which can then be loaded by your Package when it gets installed.  One example is your Notebook can train a model and save the model weights to a file which is included in the exported Package.\n\nExample code cell:\n```python\n# Train our model. Do NOT export this cell, it should only run in our Notebook.\n\nimport kagglehub\nimport keras\nimport polars as pl\n\nmodel = keras.Model(...)\nmodel.fit(...)\n\nmodel_weights_path = kagglehub.get_package_asset_path('model.keras')\nmodel.save(model_weights_path)\n```\n\nThen we'd write our inference Model in another code cell, making sure to export it:\n```python\n#| export\n\nimport kagglehub\nimport keras\n\nclass Model:\n    def __init__(self):\n        model_weights_path = kagglehub.get_package_asset_path('model.keras')\n        self.model = keras.saving.load_model(model_weights_path)\n\n    def predict(self, prompt):\n        return self.model.predict(prompt)\n```\n\nThe first cell will run during `Save Version` and write `model.keras` to your Notebook's Output Package.  Then when your Package is imported later, it will include `model.keras` and the code can read that file as shown.\n\nThis setup pairs well with the Notebook Editor's `Submit to competition` option.  You can change some model hyperparameters, click `Submit to competition`, which triggers a `Save Version` which executes your Notebook and exports a Package, and then automatically submits your resulting Package upon completion.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Install python dependencies using Dependency Manager\n\nKaggle Notebooks have many popular python packages pre-installed in their base Docker Image, but there's a lot of great packages not pre-installed which you may want to use.

This is important for our goal of having reproducible artifacts, and also means that your Notebook (or Package) can use those dependencies in a competition scoring session where internet access is not allowed.\n\nIn the Notebook Editor menu select `Add-ons` -> `Install Dependencies` and write your `pip install ...` commands. In your Interactive Notebook Editor session, you'll need to manually Run from the Dependency Manager window to install them; this requires an active Notebook session with Internet enabled, though note that you'll have to then disable Internet if you want to submit to a competition. When you Save your Notebook, your dependencies will be installed prior to the Save execution even if your Notebook has internet disabled.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Using your Model externally\n\nWith `kagglehub` you can import and run your exported Package anywhere.
